NoCrossTSP 

תיאור
NoCrossTSP – A brute-force solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that efficiently eliminates self-intersecting paths, ensuring optimal routes without unnecessary crossings. 🚀
This project is the result of years of dedication. The idea behind it stems from the belief that every intersection is unnecessary and can be replaced with straight lines, a concept I first encountered back in 3rd grade when my teacher used rubber bands to demonstrate.
I started developing approaches to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem during my military service, roughly 15 years ago. The Python code you see here is just a demonstration of the NoCrossTSP concept I’ve developed over the years. I believe it's possible to optimize the solution even further and find the shortest path in a very short time, potentially through a formula.
I've kept this project to myself for a long time, but I’ve come to realize that it’s not good to be alone. I'm not the strongest at programming, but I excel in logic and analysis. If anyone needs help or has questions, I’d be more than happy to assist.

If used for profit, I would be happy to receive a symbolic percentage. meir.elizarov@gmail.com
